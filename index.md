# Varad

Independent researcher exploring **reflective and self-evaluating AI systems**.

My work focuses on agents that go beyond pattern prediction —
building internal world models, revising beliefs, and simulating
consequences before acting.

---

## Research Focus

- Reflective agents that evaluate consequences before action  
- World models and belief revision without gradient descent  
- Post-training intelligence and cognition loops  
- MCP-based modular cognitive architectures  

---

## Selected Projects

### Self-Evaluating Agent (MCP)
An agent architecture that:
- simulates outcomes before acting
- evaluates risk, uncertainty, and irreversibility
- can deliberately choose **inaction**

*Status:* Ongoing research prototype

---

### Chain-of-Thought Branch Parallelism
Exploring parallel hypothesis evaluation instead of single-path reasoning,
with emphasis on uncertainty handling and failure modes.

---

### Semantic Transfer Learning
Investigating how structured knowledge can transfer across domains
without retraining or fine-tuning.

## Writing

- *Why Agents Should Sometimes Refuse to Act* (coming soon)
- *Negative Results in Chain-of-Thought Parallelism* (coming soon)
